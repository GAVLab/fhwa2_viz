TO DO LIST

-Google Earth image of the track
	-display when zoomed out to point where not grainy

-Determine other track display methods
	-Blender mesh? ==> Determine if collada didn't display b/c it was a plane only

-**Robustify code**
	-to read track data, lat/lon survey files currently have to be in same directory
		-convert into UTM files
		-make the code work if data is in a separate survey data file
	-break into modules
	-make 

- ensure that error ellipses are being oriented properly

-enable multiple position & covariance inputs
	-go with decimal lat/lon coord sys for now
		-determine coord sys for other data sets
	-when told which position solution "best"
		-do meat of display thereby
			-car model
			-dominant odom arrows
		-indicate which is best
		-determine input method for "best" solution 
	-determine how to compare
		-legend/color system?
		-sizing

-for devel purposes, acquire multiple datasets
	- ~100Hz
	- could just add white noise to 

-start a separate demo folder in repository

-simulating on-line operation: 
	-learn pMOOSBridge
	-simulate car system as another MOOSDB
		-run alog file in vehSimDB
		-msgs cross over via pMOOSBridge
		-enter bridgeDB

	- got halfway working with pMOOSBridge, now need ros to meet halfway with the pMOOSBridge
