TO DO LIST

-Google Earth image of the track
	-display when zoomed out to point where not grainy

-Determine other track display methods
	-Blender mesh? ==> Determine if collada didn't display b/c it was a plane only
	-now have framework in place, config file saved, just need to get into non-planar form?

-**Robustify code**
	-to read track data, lat/lon survey files currently have to be in same directory
		-convert into UTM files
		-make the code work if data is in a separate survey data file
	-file operations
	-loop randmcnally.survey() rather than script out long-form
	-file operation at vehicle mesh file in  pub_at_position()

- ensure that error ellipses are being oriented properly

-enable multiple position & covariance inputs
	-go with decimal lat/lon coord sys for now
		-determine coord sys for other data sets
	-when told which position solution "best"
		-do meat of display thereby
			-car model
			-dominant odom arrows
		-indicate which is best
		-determine input method for "best" solution 
	-determine how to compare
		-legend/color system?
		-sizing?
	-for devel purposes, acquire multiple datasets
		- ~100Hz
		- could just add white noise to 

-setup launch file to automatically load fhwa2 rviz configuration file

- pub_at_position() input error message??

-get color working on G mesh model
