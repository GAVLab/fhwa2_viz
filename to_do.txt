setting callbacks necessary?
=================



- in fpv: fix latching on view switch - in mapBridge.py


- sensors:
  -will have correct and errant positions to compare
  -subsystems
    -fix DSRC/Kapsch thing

-better/prettier stacking of odom/err_ell markers
	-make the novatel/integrated solution dominate

-make colors look better

- get track stripes/ lane marking mesh from blender working

-in mailroom.gather_odom_var(), use pop instead of a list then delete in a for loop
    -deque?

- interpolate log file to get ~100Hz

- mesh of lane markings visible from all angles (make non-planar)

0-all sensors into single marker array?

unfinished positions will likely cause memory leaks

keep an array of covariances?

make lane marking meshes turnable offable whilst making them pretty
